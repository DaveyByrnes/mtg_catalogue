# mtg_catalogue

This is a solo Python project for tracking my Magic: The Gathering card collection.

My goals are to:

* Load my cards from Excel
* Pull card details from the Scryfall API
* Output a clean Excel file for deckbuilding
*   And maybe eventually try to develop my own program to do this within
